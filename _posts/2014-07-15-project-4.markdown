description: Since middle school, I have been making artwork out of duct tape. For my first couple years at Ohio State, the brand new "Tom W Davis" Clocktower was a big meme among students. Many thought it was a waste of money, others disliked the large, bright LCD screen, and some just thought it was ugly and uninspired. I had a large undecorated wall, so I decided to honor this clocktower by turning it into artwork. I'm not sure why I didn't include the clock at the top of my rendition. Along with this piece, I have made many other duct tape art pieces, mostly as Christmas gifts. The process involves creating a design in Photoshop, printing it out at 1:1 scale, then clear taping the paper over the respective color tape and cutting it out. These are then pieced together like a puzzle, and can get very intricate.
