description: As a Christmas gift, I made a fasces. The fasces is an American symbol derived from ancient Rome. It consists of a bundle of rods/sticks, usually surrounding an axe/hatchet. It symbolizes collective strength, as a single rod is easy to break, but when bound together, the group is much stronger. The axe further symbolizes that this collective is not to be messed with. The fasces can be seen everywhere in American iconography, from official seals, monuments, and to architecture. The fasces is proudly shown in the US House of Representatives, directly behind the Speaker of the House. In Columbus, it can be seen from all sides carved into the stone at the top of LeVeque Tower, an art deco style skyscraper built in 1927, and in Cincinnati is a statue depicting the Ancient Roman leader, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus (for whom the city is named) with his plow in one hand, and the other outstretched, presenting a fasces.
