description: I sewed and embroidered an American flag from scratch as a Christmas gift. I used a high quality cotton duck canvas and used a slightly darker red and blue than is traditionally used, which I think looks nice as a display flag. It took me attempting a couple tiny flags and one full size nylon flag to get comfortable with my ability to sew neatly and in straight lines, though this flag is still not perfect. For the 13 stars on the canton (the blue rectangle), I used an embroidery machine. The embroidery field on my machine is somewhat small, so I had to do each star individually, readjusting the position and rotation for each star. I then attached the finished canton to the rest of the flags and added a header with grommets and year embroidered.
