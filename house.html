                    <p>Excavation and footer pouring are the only parts of the build where I have paid a professional to do it for me. After digging the footers at the end of April, we experienced a lot of rain that would constantly fill in the trench and prevent us from being able to pour the concrete for about a month and a half. We were eventually we were able to pour the footers mid-June. Although a basement would have been nice, I decided on a crawlspace for cost reasons. Despite not being as deep as a basement, it still runs into some ground water in the front-right corner, so I installed a foundation drain around the footer. </p>

                            <p>I was originally going to pay a mason to build the block wall for me, but ultimately decided to do it myself. I bought a used concrete mixer, which immediately broke, so I mixed most of the mortar by hand. The dimensions are 30'x24' and 7 courses high. Including the pillars for the girder in the center, it was slightly over 600 blocks. I combined sand and portland cement to create my own grout and poured it into the CMU cells containing rebar to add strength to the wall.</p>

                            <p>I built the floor joists with #1 Grade 2x10s 24" OC and then used 3/4" Tongue and Groove OSB for the subfloor. The hole in the middle was a last minute addition. It is situated under the stairs, so I figured, thanks to its improved headspace, it could be used to house any tall mechanical equipment that I want to place in the crawl space; such as a water heater. We'll see if I actually use it.</p>

                                            <p>Being a Cape Cod, the second floor is actually the attic. In order to increase headroom, a 26' long shed dormer was built along the rear of the house. Once this wall was raised, the 2x8 roof rafters were set 24" OC. I decided to build the side-wall of the shed dormer on the ground, but what I did not anticipate was how hard it would be to set it in place. After being unsuccessful, I used a come-along and a rope thrown over the ridge board. Even with this, it still took about an hour to set the wall on my own.  </p>

                                                    <p>I was able to sheathe the roof almost entirely from the inside using a ladder, but I knew I couldn't do this for the shingles. I have always had issues with heights, so some people close to me wanted me to hire this part out. This isn't something I seriously considered, because overcoming my fear was important to me (and the high cost to hire roofers, too). I built scaffolding so that I could easily access the bottom rows of roof and used roof jacks with 2x6s so that I always had something under my feet. I used a harness and rope so I that I would be ok if I did fall. With time, I started to become very comfortable on the roof. I, many times, would look at the rope and find that there was so much slack, it was doing essentially nothing to protect me, but I wasn't worried because I trusted that I wasn't going to fall.     </p>

                                                    <p>My dad helped me install windows and doors. The windows were pretty quick to install, but going around after and adding the flashing tape was tedious. You may notice I changed the layout of the windows on the front of the house. My mom first suggested it, and then popular opinion agreed that it would look better with 2 windows on each side of the door, and ultimately I agreed, as it's also more true to the Cape Cod architectural style. It took about a half day to move the window opening from the side of the house to the front. I'm glad I took the time to change it, and think the facade will look good with brickmould and shutters. I'm not a huge fan of how the windows look on the gable end of the house now, but it's something I can live with.
