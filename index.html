            <h1>Bryce A Redmond</h1>
            <p id="introText">I am a 26 year old man who grew up in the Columbus suburbs but moved to Southeast Ohio several years ago. I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2021 with a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my time in college, I worked every weeknight as a Package Handler at the Columbus FedEx Ground hub. I enjoyed the job and for my final two semesters, I was promoted to an Operations Manager role, where I discovered my love of polo shirts and greatly improved my ability to be a part of and lead a team. It was during this time that I set my sights on someday building my own house, and I am now finally following through. From designing the home in AutoCAD and Revit, to building it with nail guns and circular saws, I have done everything on my own; with some help from my dad. You can see pictures and read about my progress here, and I've included some of my various other projects, as well.</p>
